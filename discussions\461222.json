I've tested each one in the last several minutes, closing each one before launching the next.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I get to version 1.5 there are 2 big differences. First, I get a warning about the file not having a digital signature (something I do not get with any of the others) and second every second, once enabled, instead of simple movement the program creates a right click, over and over again, bringing up context menus and the like.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm downloading directly from the official list here:\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://mousejiggler.codeplex.com/releases/view/111207\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://mousejiggler.codeplex.com/releases/view/111207</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nSince I'm always on the lookout for scam downloads on software sites, I did notice that 1.5 is a different name (MouseJiggler vs MouseJiggle) so can you also confirm that the 1.5 listed in the downloads list is the current download?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
