The &quot;Enable jiggle&quot; mode works fine for this, but when I check the Zen jiggle it no longer works, and the scroll bar disappears, so it would seem that the Zen mode is not fooling Word. It would be really nice if it did, since then I could have a stable cursor (without real jiggle) and achieve a static scroll bar. Why doesn't Zen mode achieve this?<br />\n",
