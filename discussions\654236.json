However, when I download and compile the source code in Visual Studio 2015 on Windows 7, everything runs and SendInput returns 1 as expected, but the mouse doesn't move (the same behavior I am seeing in my own program).  I have tried compiling both for x86 and 64 bit (64 bit will not run at all.. I presume the input structure size is different on 64 bit systems)\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I run the executable, the mouse moves as expected.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone else successfully compiled the source code and got it to work?<br />\n",
