    "Description": "In v1.3, after clicking the 'minimize to tray' down-arrow button on the interface, it appears that the application does not minimize correctly; while the application icon is added to the systray, the application leaves a window open at the bottom-left under WinXP and Win7 rather than cleanly closing all interface windows. \nClosing this remnant (with the still-present [X] box at top right) appears to end the program.",
