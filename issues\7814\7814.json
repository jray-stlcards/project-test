    "Description": "Mouse Jiggler works just fine on my computer IF and ONLY IF it is the selected/active window.  The second I minimize with the green arrow button, or open any window \"over\" it, the jiggling stops working.\r\n\r\nAny clue why this happens?\r\n\r\nFor What it is worth, I have tried other mouse jiggling type programs that say to do the same thing, and all of those act the same way.  Is there some computer setting I don't have correct?  Window 7 SP1.\r\n\r\n",
